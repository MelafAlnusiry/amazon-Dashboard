## Amazon Prime Dashboard
This dashboard displays various visualizations of company insights.<br />

It demonstrates the following insights in particular:<br />
•     Which language movies are found more in Amazon Prime videos.<br />
•     Top movies by IMDB rating.<br />
•     Distribution of movies and TV shows.<br />
•     Highest release of movies based on years.<br />
•     Count of movies based on timing.<br />
